Real-Time Sign Language Recognition

This project implements a real-time recognition system for sign language alphabets and numbers using a Convolutional 
Neural Network (CNN) and MediaPipe for hand landmark detection. The system captures live video input, processes hand 
gestures, and classifies them into corresponding sign language alphabets or numbers.

Project Structure

- CNNModel.py: Defines the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture used for classifying hand gestures.
- training.py: Script used for training the CNN model on datasets of hand gestures or numbers.
- testCNN.py: Script for testing the performance of the trained CNN model on a test dataset.
- mediapipeHandDetection.py: Integrates MediaPipe to perform real-time hand detection and display landmarks through the webcam.
- realTime.py: Main script that integrates the CNN model and MediaPipe for real-time hand gesture recognition and classification.
- handLandMarks.py: Processes MediaPipe's hand landmarks for generating datasets suitable for training the CNN model.
- numbers_testing_data.xlsx: Example processed dataset for testing numeric gesture recognition.
- CNN_model_alphabet_SIBI.pth: Pre-trained CNN model weights for sign language alphabets classification.
- CNN_model_number_SIBI.pth: Pre-trained CNN model weights for numeric gesture classification.

How to Run the Project

1. Install Dependencies

Ensure Python is installed. Install the required Python packages using:


pip install opencv-python mediapipe torch numpy pandas

2. Running Real-Time Recognition

For real-time sign language or numeric gesture recognition, run:

python realTime.py

This will activate your webcam and start detecting and classifying hand gestures in real-time.

3. Training the Model (Optional)

To train the CNN model from scratch using a dataset of hand gestures, run:

python training.py

4. Testing the Model (Optional)

To evaluate the trained CNN model's performance on a test dataset, run:

python testCNN.py

How It Works

1. Hand Landmark Detection: 
   - MediaPipe detects and tracks hand landmarks in real-time from the webcam feed.

2. Feature Extraction:
   - Hand landmarks are processed and normalized to be used as input features for the CNN model.

3. Gesture Classification:
   - The CNN model classifies the input features into one of the predefined sign language alphabets (A-Z) or numeric gestures (1-9).

4. Real-Time Feedback:
   - The classified gesture is displayed in real-time, providing immediate feedback to the user.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- NumPy

Notes

- The system supports both alphabetic and numeric gestures based on the pre-trained model loaded 
  (CNN_model_alphabet_SIBI.pth or CNN_model_number_SIBI.pth).
- Ensure the training and test datasets are preprocessed and structured correctly as required by the CNN model.
